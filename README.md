# Rock Paper Scissors Console Game

This repository contains a simple, vanilla JavaScript implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors that you can play in your browser's console.

## How to Play

1. Open your internet browser.
2. Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` to open the developer console.
3. Copy the JavaScript code from the `rock_paper_scissors.js` file in this repository.
4. Paste the copied code into your console and press `Enter`.
5. The game will start and you will be prompted to enter your choice: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
6. The computer will also make a choice, and the winner will be determined based on the classic game rules.

## Game Rules

- Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
- Scissors cut Paper (Scissors win)
- Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)

If both you and the computer make the same choice, it's a draw.
